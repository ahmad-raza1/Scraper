This paper proposes enhancement in popular on demand routing protocol AODV [2] by improving its local repair mechanism. Enhanced Local Repair AODV (ELRAODV) makes mobile nodes more aware of the local connectivity by extending original HELLO to NHELLO message in AODV as proposed in [3]. That extra information of the local neighbors allows ELRAODV to repair a route by sending a unicast request instead to broadcast in original AODV. The results show that ELRAODV performs better in terms of routing overhead, end to end delay than classic AODV. The simulation is done through network Simulator-2 (ns2). Collapse'}

Routing in flying ad-hoc networks (FANETs) with UAVs is a challenging issue because of the high speed and sudden changes in direction of UAVs. Traditional routing protocols in FANETs periodically send hello messages for the establishment and maintenance of the routes. However, sending hello messages periodically after a fixed interval increases bandwidth wastage when the hello interval is excessively short or causes long delays in neighbour discovery when the hello interval is overly long. Moreover, several disconnected UAV groups have been observed in which the group members are connected among themselves but detached from the main network. By exchanging excessive hello messages inside the group, the UAVs maintain an unnecessary neighbourhood, causing wastage of energy. However, FANETs have certain advantages, such as knowledge about mission-related information. To solve the problem of unnecessary energy drain, we propose a novel adaptive hello interval scheme\xe2\x80\x94energy efficient hello (EE-Hello)\xe2\x80\x94based on available mission-related information, such as the volume of the allowed airspace, number of UAVs, UAV transmission range, and UAV speed. We present a method to decide the distance that a UAV needs to travel before sending a hello message. We also specify a technique to determine the number of UAVs necessary to achieve specific network requirements, such as packet delivery ratio or throughput, with the expenditure of minimum energy. We show that the proposed EE-Hello can save about 25% of the energy currently used, by suppressing unnecessary hello messages without degrading the overall network throughput. Collapse'}

In this article, a new reactive routing protocol has been proposed which is considered as a major extension of both Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Mobility and Direction Aware AODV (MDA-AODV) prior routing protocols. It is named as Mobility Aware and Dual Phase Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector with Adaptive Hello Messages (MA-DP-AODV-AHM). It primarily concentrates on building routes considering vehicles\xe2\x80\x99 speeds and direction of motion with respect to source vehicles, thereby establishing more stable routes and reducing the route breakages. Not only to this extent, but rather, we proposed an adaptive control packet announcement mechanism, which is directly connected to the periodic hello messages approach, with vehicles\xe2\x80\x99 speeds, yielding a significant reduction in the amount of control overhead and congestion over the network. Moreover, the new protocol is proposed to alternate working among two phases, for the reason of guaranteeing the generation of efficient routes on a timely basis, which include MA-DP-AODV-AHM and AODV protocols. Our protocol has been evaluated in terms of control overhead, end-to-end delay, and energy consumption using QualNet simulator version 7.1 in which enormous simulations have been conducted under the base of vehicle density, packet rate, and constant bit rate connections. Simulation results summarize that MA-DP-AODV-AHM contributes efficiently in mitigating the network instability through generating effective stable routes and reducing link failures. Furthermore, it has proved its superiority over AODV and MDA-AODV. Collapse'}

Until recently, a major barrier in addressing this significant public health issue is the fact that the majority of individuals with alcohol use disorders and alcohol misuse are not receiving treatment. Objective This study aimed to assess whether alcohol consumption changes are associated with participation in Hello Sunday Morning\xe2\x80\x99s blog platform, an online forum discussing experiences in abstaining from alcohol. Methods The study reports on Hello Sunday Morning participants who signed up for a 3-month period of abstinence from November 2009 to November 2016. The sample comprised 1917 participants (female: 1227/1917, 64.01%; male: 690/1917, 35.99%). Main outcome measures were Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) scores, mood, program engagement metrics, and slip-ups. Results Individuals who reported hazardous (preprogram AUDIT mean 11.92, SD 2.25) and harmful consumption levels (preprogram AUDIT mean 17.52, SD 1.08) and who engaged in the Hello Sunday Morning program reported a significant decrease in alcohol consumption, moving to lower risk consumption levels (hazardous, mean 7.59, SD 5.70 and harmful, mean 10.38, SD 7.43), 4 months following program commencement (P<.001). Those who reported high-risk or dependent consumption levels experienced the biggest reduction (preprogram mean 25.38, SD 4.20), moving to risky consumption (mean 15.83, SD 11.11), 4 months following program commencement (P<.001). These reductions in risk were maintained by participants in each group, 7 months following program commencement. Furthermore, those who engaged in the program more (as defined by more sign-ins, blogs posted, check-ins completed, and engagement with the community through likes and following) had lower alcohol consumption. Finally, those who experienced more slip-ups had lower alcohol consumption. Conclusions Participation in an online forum can support long-term behavior change in individuals wishing to change their drinking behavior. Importantly, reductions in AUDIT scores appeared larger for those drinking at high-risk and hazardous levels before program commencement. This has promising implications for future models of alcohol reduction treatment, as online forums are an anonymous, accessible, and cost-effective alternative or adjunct to treatment-as-usual. Further research is needed into the specific mechanisms of change within a Web-based supportive community, as well as the role of specific mood states in predicting risky drinking behavior.

We also provide our recommendations for smart toys manufacturers to address these issues for the future products. Collapse'}

It requires real-time response and high accuracy for good user experience. Recently, neural networks have become an attractive choice for KWS architecture because of their superior accuracy compared to traditional speech processing algorithms. Due to its always-on nature, KWS application has highly constrained power budget and typically runs on tiny microcontrollers with limited memory and compute capability. The design of neural network architecture for KWS must consider these constraints. In this work, we perform neural network architecture evaluation and exploration for running KWS on resource-constrained microcontrollers. We train various neural network architectures for keyword spotting published in literature to compare their accuracy and memory/compute requirements. We show that it is possible to optimize these neural network architectures to fit within the memory and compute constraints of microcontrollers without sacrificing accuracy. We further explore the depthwise separable convolutional neural network (DS-CNN) and compare it against other neural network architectures. DS-CNN achieves an accuracy of 95.4%, which is ~10% higher than the DNN model with similar number of parameters. Collapse'}

The security of WSN in such an environment is very difficult. There are many routing protocols for WSN, but LEACH is the widely used energy proficient hierarchical routing protocol which saves nodes energy by forming clusters. In LEACH, cluster member forwards its data to the cluster head, which then aggregate and forward the entire data it received from member nodes to the base station. There are various types of attacks which threaten the services of LEACH are Sybil attack, black hole, selective forwarding, and Hello flooding attack. Hello flooding attack is a type of DoS attack which degrades the performance of LEACH by continuously sending large number of cluster head advertisement packets. Inside this text, firstly, we have discussed LEACH routing protocol and how it can be compromised by Hello flooding attackers. Once we threaten the services of LEACH by Hello flood attack, the impact of attacks on the performance metrics of LEACH is evaluated. In this paper, we have also proposed a detection strategy using coordinator nodes which detect the nodes causing Hello flood attack and then prevent it. The performance of algorithm is then tested using the NS-2 simulator. Collapse'}

Personality Impressions from Brief Novel Voices', 'abstract': b'On hearing a novel voice, listeners readily form personality impressions of that speaker. Accurate or not, these impressions are known to affect subsequent interactions; yet the underlying psychological and acoustical bases remain poorly understood. Furthermore, hitherto studies have focussed on extended speech as opposed to analysing the instantaneous impressions we obtain from first experience. In this paper, through a mass online rating experiment, 320 participants rated 64 sub-second vocal utterances of the word \xe2\x80\x98hello\xe2\x80\x99 on one of 10 personality traits. We show that: (1) personality judgements of brief utterances from unfamiliar speakers are consistent across listeners; (2) a two-dimensional \xe2\x80\x98social voice space\xe2\x80\x99 with axes mapping Valence (Trust, Likeability) and Dominance, each driven by differing combinations of vocal acoustics, adequately summarises ratings in both male and female voices; and (3) a positive combination of Valence and Dominance results in increased perceived male vocal Attractiveness, whereas perceived female vocal Attractiveness is largely controlled by increasing Valence. Results are discussed in relation to the rapid evaluation of personality and, in turn, the intent of others, as being driven by survival mechanisms via approach or avoidance behaviours. These findings provide empirical bases for predicting personality impressions from acoustical analyses of short utterances and for generating desired personality impressions in artificial voices.

Hello Sunday Morning asks participants to stop consuming alcohol for a period of time, set a goal and document their progress on a personal blog. Hello Sunday Morning is a unique health intervention for three interrelated reasons: (1) it was generated outside a clinical setting, (2) it uses new media technologies to create structured forms of participation in an iterative and open-ended way and (3) participants generate a written record of their progress along with demographic, behavioural and engagement data. This article presents a text analysis of the blog posts of Hello Sunday Morning participants using the software program Leximancer. Analysis of blogs illustrates how participants\xe2\x80\x99 expressions change over time. In the first month, participants tended to set goals, describe their current drinking practices in individual and cultural terms, express hopes and anxieties and report on early efforts to change. After month 1, participants continued to report on efforts to change and associated challenges and reflect on their place as individuals in a drinking culture. In addition to this, participants evaluated their efforts to change and presented their \xe2\x80\x98findings\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98theorised\xe2\x80\x99 them to provide advice for others.
